# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning 🫀🤖

This project is a machine learning-based predictive model designed to assess the risk of heart disease using clinical data.

## 🚀 Features
- Utilizes clinical dataset with 11+ health features
- Implements multiple ML models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, and XGBoost
- Data preprocessing: encoding, scaling, and feature selection
- Interactive prediction using a Python function

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Sample Dataset
The dataset includes features like:
- Age
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Chest Pain Type
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- ECG results
...and more.



## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-ml-predictor`
2. Navigate to the folder  
   `cd heart-disease-ml-predictor`
